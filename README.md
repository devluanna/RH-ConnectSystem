# Backend API for 'System HR'
This API is the construction of a very complex HR System, I have been studying and putting my knowledge into practice in the development of this API.
<br />
ðŸ’» Technologies used:
- Java 17
- Spring Boot Framework
- Maven
- In-memory database using H2
<br /><br />

âœ¨ There are still some features missing and some code needs to be refactored.

Initial diagram (some things were changed during the development process).
